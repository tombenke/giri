## About the giri system

This is the main project of the Garden Irrigator (shortly giri) System.

It is a case-study on how to develop simple, micro-services based, distributed systems, including:
    - specification writing,
    - designing,
    - implementation & testing,
    - deployment & operation.

This project provides examples of how to use tools created for rapid development using archetypes of:
    - UI framework,
    - UI frontend containers and components,
    - REST service endpoints,
    - web api proxys,
    - microservice worker modules,
    - IoT/WoT functional units.

It demonstrates the usage of [Seneca.js](http://senecajs.org) JavaScript micro-service framework.

This is an umbrella project.

It contains only the main specification and supporting materials, under the docs folder.
