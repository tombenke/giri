## About the giri system

This is the main project of the Garden Irrigator (shortly giri) System.

This is an umbrella project. It contains only the main specification and supporting materials, under the docs folder.
Visit the [wiki pages](https://github.com/tombenke/giri/wiki) for furher information on the product.

The intention with developing of this project is twofold:

- Provide a real irrigator system that is useful in the everyday life.
- The project can also serve as a case study on how to develop micro-services based, distributed systems.

The case study includes:

- specification writing,
- designing,
- implementation & testing,
- deployment & operation.

This project provides examples of how to use tools created for rapid development using archetypes of:

- UI framework,
- UI frontend containers and components,
- REST service endpoints,
- web api proxys,
- microservice worker modules,
- IoT/WoT functional units (hardware and firmware).

You can find detailed documentation and workshop materials about the case study and rapid development tools on the wiki under the [Workshop materials](https://github.com/tombenke/giri/wiki/Workshop Materials) page.

It demonstrates the usage of [Seneca.js](http://senecajs.org) JavaScript micro-service framework.
